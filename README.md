# PersonalProject

I just wanted to "break the ice" in making my sort of personal projects, and thought this
would be a nice place to start. With my simple weather app, I was able to make something that 
will tell me the weather for the day in school, if it's safe (for me and my comfort level
in driving) to drive to school that day, tell me if I'll need a jacket, or if it's going to
be a perfect day out. It also helped me in a sense that it was my first time utilizing an API
to create a program. On top of that, building this weather app helped me get back into python,
which I haven't touched since my Intro to Coding class my sophomore year of high school (almost
four years now!). I had a lot of fun building this simple program, and want to come back to it 
eventually and perhaps make a full fledged mobile app to give me the same sort of notifications, 
just on my phone and a lot easier to access, not having to turn on my laptop and run the code.

:D
